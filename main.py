Public Release V1.0 AzamiDB
This is the first build of Azami and contains all the cogs I made before V2.0
V2.0 will be released when Azami V3.0 is made and the date is TBD
Note: This is old code so a lot of things here may be inefficient or wasteful. 
All this code was changed in 2.0 and was written better, cleaner and way more efficient
You can go ahead and reprogram it if you want and manipulate it to your heart content!
Or just use it as it is, as it does work. All changes have to be local and will not replace
the github version.
P.S Some code was changed a little for this release.

Installing Steps - Read the readme.md
The cogs the bot has:
basic.py
dnd.py
fun.py
help.py
jojo.py
maths.py
mod.py
owner.py
server.py

Thanks for reading this extra info. Have fun programmers!
